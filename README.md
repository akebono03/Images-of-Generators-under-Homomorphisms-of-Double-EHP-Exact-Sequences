The calculation of homotopy groups of spheres is a fundamental problem in algebraic topology.  
For an odd prime p, the double EHP sequence is one of the fundamental tools for determining the p-components of the homotopy groups of spheres.
E^2 denotes the double suspension homomorphism.  
H represents the generalized Hopf invariant.  
P corresponds to the Whitehead product.  
This application, in particular for p=3, provides images of these homomorphisms.
